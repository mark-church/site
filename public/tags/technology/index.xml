      <description>There are more than a few options out there to host a blog these days. But this is a technical blog and as one of my first posts, I wanted to provide a technical tutorial on how it was deployed and what I learned.
For this site, I wanted to own the full technical stack, for two reaons:
 to have full control over every functional and design aspect of the site to fully understand how the site software stack works from the operating system on up  The site is only made from open source software so if I wanted to edit some miniscule detail, I have full power to do that.</description>
