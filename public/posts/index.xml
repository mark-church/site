      <description>My original motivation for creating this site was just to have a real use-case for Envoy. But while looking for ways to shoehorn envoy in to the stack, I actually found a lot of really useful things that I could use it for. I’m excited to FINALLY get around to deploying it so let’s get moving!
 If you&#39;re asking yourself &amp;quot;what&#39;s envoy&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;who are you and why am I reading this&amp;quot;, go back and check out the pre-reading for this post:

      <description>This post began as part 2 but after crossing several pages just explaining what envoy is, it was obvious this answer deserved to stand on its own, giving us part 1.5.
 In part 1 of this series we deployed a very simple blog with a site generation app called Hugo. We did things quick and dirty and used Hugo&#39;s built-in development server to serve the content so we were live in less than 15 minutes. Calling it a blog at this point in time would be super generous, but thank you anyways! What we have right now is a bicycle, but what we want is an Airbus A380 (on an open source bicycle budget) .</description>

      <description>There are more than a few options out there to host a blog these days. But this is a technical blog and as one of my first posts, I wanted to provide a technical tutorial on how it was deployed and what I learned.
For this site, I wanted to own the full technical stack, for two reasons:
 to have full control over every functional and design aspect of the site to fully understand how the site software stack works from the operating system on up  The site is only made from open source software so if I wanted to edit some miniscule detail, I have full power to do that.</description>

      <description>Until you’re 22 or 23, life is like a video game. Once you leave the introductory level of daycare that teaches you the what the buttons do (run, jump, kick, poop) you start on the first level of this video game — elementary school. From that point forward you’re leveling up. Everybody that started with you is (mostly) leveling up along with you on the same path and rate. You don’t even have to be that good to get to the next level, just don’t completely screw it up and they’ll let you move forward with everybody else.
After leveling for a number of years, you hit one of the most exciting parts of the game — college.</description>
