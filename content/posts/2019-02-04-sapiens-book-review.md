There’s a great quote from Prof. Harari in his follow-up to Sapiens, Homo Deus, that should be at the beginning of every history book. It sums up why studying history is important. On the best reason to learn history he says ...

>… not in order to predict the future, but to free yourself of the past and imagine alternative destinies.

Frequently through his books he shows how aspects of culture and society that we today accept as unmovable cornerstones, are often just the result of chance events in history. There are many historical events that, had they gone just a little bit differently, perhaps you would not be using the same currency, or speaking the same language, or have the same level of wealth that you have today. 

Not only is our society formed by chance, it changes frequently, sometimes every human generation. Even the oldest living people today have experienced just a tiny sliver of humanity’s history. A few generations back cultural norms, beliefs, and cultural cornerstones were completely different.. We find it hard to recognize that our entire existence has lived on one tiny slope of a very long and winding curve. 

The recognition of this chance and our momentary view of history loosens the tight grip that our present reality has on us. It puts into perspective how extraordinarily alien the past is. This allows us to imagine alternative futures that are more grounded in the random odds of history and less as a mirror and extension of your present moment.

## Book Review
I read Sapiens in about 6 days after randomly buying it at a train station. It went surprisingly quick, despite being a large book. Prof. Harari writes on many diverse topics and so I’ll cover just four major ideas that I took away.

## Timeline of Human History
I’ve never had a good perspective of the timeline of humanity. Sapiens jumps all over this timeline, but here are highlights …



## The Agricultural Revolution
For 90% of humanity’s history, we lived as isolated groups of hunter-gatherers. These groups were highly dynamic and generally traveled with, multiplied, and perished in accordance with with their sources of food. These groups were mobile and sourced nutrients from various sources, depending on the location and time of year. 

This did not mean that the hunter-gatherers lived terrible lives. They simply adapted to their environment as opposed to the other way around. It’s easy to idealize this lifestyle since they were using their bodies and their brains for exactly what they had evolved to do. These humans were identical in terms of DNA to modern humans, but they were more like animals in that they depended so much on their environment for survival.

We have evidence that the first signs of sustained farming began shortly before 10,000BC. Over a few thousand years it sprang up independently across Turkey, South America, and China. Agriculture such as wheat farming or sheep herding brought an abundance of control over food sources. Instead of adapting to the environment, wheat fields were plowed and the environment was adapted to the needs of humans. This control allowed humans to greatly expand the aggregate amount of food available. 

The reliability of agriculture was what allowed the first great civilizations to form. Now that a food source was (relatively) stable, fixed in one location, and directly scalable, large groups of humans could band together to build cities around their production of food.

Prof. Harari makes an interesting observation about the Agricultural Revolution. As often depicted, it was not an instantaneous life improvement and escape from the brutish lifestyle of the hunter-gatherer’s. In many ways, agriculture led to worse lives for the individual, even while being a massive improvement for society as a whole. The reason is that Agriculture brought new problems that did not exist in hunter-gatherer societies.

- Property & War - With food production being fixed in one location and highly controllable, the concept of property began to take roots. Because man was more responsible for his fortune and the environment was less responsible for providing what was needed, concepts around ownership gave birth. Food was no longer an ephemeral resource like the catch of a big hunt. It could be amassed and stored for long periods of time. There was now valuable property that one tribe might want to steal from another tribe. This lead to entirely new types of conflict, not based on hunting turf, but over the resources themselves. Humans now had to protect themselves and their resources which required governments and soldiers. The need to protect property made society more concentrated than it ever was before.
- Less Diversification - In early agrarian societies, there was little diversification as far as food sources go. In China they cultivated rice and pigs while in Central America it was maize and beans. Agriculture was often less diversified than its hunter-gatherer equivalent. This led to worse diets and higher risks of hunger. Hunter-gatherer groups followed herds or weather patterns and were as a result smaller, but more dynamic. The agricultural revolution brought broad stability and more food, but at the risk of famine, bad weather, or war which could eliminate the only food sources in existence.
- More Concentration - Fixed locations, more government, and more security all led to more concentrated societies. This led to a variety of problems, never encountered before, from large groups of humans living in proximity. Disease became more rampant as well as large-scale oppression. The concentration of wealth allowed small groups of oppressors to reap value at large-scale.

Of course, none of mankind's great achievements would have been possible without agriculture. For society it was a great leap forward, but for the individual, it led to thousands of years of new problems that led to more difficult lives than those of the hunter-gatherers. The Agricultural Revolution is one of several interesting examples in Sapiens of the discrepancy between individual suffering and human progress.


## One World Society
One of the more interesting observations is that today there is effectively one single world society. There are a few examples of isolated human tribes in the world that have refused to make contact with the rest, but otherwise we are one interconnected society. 

In 1450, there were still a few independent societies that existed. The Afro-Asian society held 90% of the human race while Andean, native Australian, Mesoamerican, and Oceanic cultures held the rest. At that point in time, there was no contact or trade between these groups of humans and zero influence between them. A few hundred years earlier, there were hundreds more of independent societies that had no awareness of each other. 

Over the next 300 years, the Afro-Asian society consumed all of the rest, irreversibly integrating all in to one world society. Though today we have different languages and customs, all modern societies share the same economic, legal, and scientific systems. All modern societies provide methods to trade with different currencies and agree on the structures of atoms and stars. We may think that we are very different societies, but almost all humans agree on the same conceptual ideas. 

## The Unifying Force of Money
Prof. Harari pays special attention to the history of currency and how it’s shaped history. Hunter-gatherers had no concepts of money. Their tribes were economically independent and provided for everything that the group needed on their own. Post-agricultural specializations and inter-societal trade led to the development of currencies. Currencies allowed dissimilar goods and services to be traded which allowed for even more trade and more specialization. 

Unlike bartering which was trade of two things of value, currency had no intrinsic value. Currency required trust. The first known currency, Sumerian barley money in 3000BC, did have intrinsic value, but as the concept of currency matured, trust in the idea increased and intrinsic value became less necessary.

As inter-societal trade increased through use of currency, interesting forces appeared between cultures. The forces of supply and demand would always equalize prices across distinct markets. Hypothetically, if Africans did not value gold, yet the Spaniards did then Spaniards would trade their resources for cheap gold to sell in Spanish markets. Simply because Africans could get something of value for gold, it would give them a reason to value gold more. More gold in Spanish markets would reduce its price there and increase its price in African markets until the price of gold was equalized between the two societies.

Simply the belief of value for a good in one society, would cause the equalization of price for that good in another society through trade, even if that good was initially considered worthless. Money created cooperation between networks of societies and humans over long distances in ways that did not occur before the invention of currency and trade. In other words, money and trade unified societies and allowed them to cooperate where religion, proximity, or war could not. 

Although cold and inhuman, systems of economic trade tended to bound cultures, for better and also for worse. It’s invisible forces equalized prices and encouraged a world society that was even more tightly bound than before.


Prof. Harari starts his history of humanity by looking at the biological forces that shaped early humans. He paints a realistic picture of how humans evolved from hunter-gatherers to modern societies with governments, armies, trade, and technology. He goes on to explore the scientific and technological revolutions that we are currently going through to paint a picture of where we are heading next. If any of this sounds remotely interesting then I recommend picking up this book.
