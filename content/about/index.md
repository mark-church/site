I'm a [product manager](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markac/) in the software infrastructure and networking space. I've always been impressed by people who write content about their profession and interests publicly, but found it difficult to get started myself. I realized two things that helped me finally start:

- You don't have to know it all. Scope down an article until you feel comfortable _enough_ to put it out there. 
- Small is better than nothing. Don't feel compelled to make every post a big project or achieve perfection, because it will never get done.

This site exists to connect me with others who also find the topics relevant so if they do, feel free to get [in touch](https://twitter.com/churchofmark) with me!
