I'm a [product manager](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markac/) in the software infrastructure and networking space. I've always been impressed by people who write content about their profession and interests. I realized two things that finally helped me start doing it myself:

- You don't have to know it all. Scope down an article until you feel comfortable _enough_ to put it out there. 
- Small is better than nothing. Don't feel compelled to make every post a big project, because they will never get done.

Fell free to get in touch with me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/churchofmark).
